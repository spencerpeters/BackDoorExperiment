This repository contains code for computing d-separation and adjustment sets in directed graphs.






EnumerateAdjustments README

Setup:
Download ScriptServingPython.R
Use its filepath as the rScriptFilepath argument to AdjustmentEnumerator.

Usage:
python enumerateAdjustments.py rScriptFilepath JSONFilepath #graphs #nodes probabilityOfEdge outFilepath

Arguments:
rScriptFile: full filepath to ScriptServingPython.R
JSONFilepath: arbitrary filepath, used as a location for JSON data computed by the R script
#graphs: number of graphs to generate
#nodes: number of nodes per graph
ProbabilityOfEdge: the probability that any given directed edge exists in the DAG.
outFilepath: location where detailed program output will be stored

Result:
list of cuboids for each graph along with treatments at outFilepath
summary information to stdout
