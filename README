This repository contains code for computing d-separation and adjustment sets in directed graphs.

DSeparation implements Algorithm 2 for finding d-separating sets in directed graphs in
Geiger, D., Verma, T., & Pearl, J. (1990). Identifying independence in Bayesian networks. Networks, 20(5), 507-534.

TakataDSeparator and TakataSeparator make use of Takata's algorithm for separation in undirected graphs, 
along with the moral graph construction, to compute d-separation in directed graphs.
Takata, K. (2010). Space-optimal, backtracking algorithms to list the minimal vertex separators of a graph. 
Discrete Applied Mathematics, 158(15), 1660-1667. Chicago	

BackDoor uses the DSeparator class of DSeparation to compute back door sets, which are sets of variables that, when adjusted for,
yield the causal effect of a target set on an effect variable.
